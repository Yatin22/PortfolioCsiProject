        Born in bijnor U.P. Now living in bhiwadi where I had all my schooling.I was good in studies so schooling was not that hard.I belong to a fairly simple family.Growing up I was intrigued by different things other than studies.I took dancing and singing became a state champion in that field. Then I got into programming and I quickly understood that I want to do this so I am learning to be good at it now.My other hobbies include travelling and influencing.Thanks for visiting ðŸ™‚
